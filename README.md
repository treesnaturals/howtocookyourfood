Heather’s Dillema
There was this girl I met when I was in kindergarten that I swore was a chef. I had a strange dream about her, how her mom didn’t get enough respect to shop regularly at the store, like someone defiled the aisles every time and provided them with Shanti food.
Heterotrophic Face Paint
I think all people named Fran were seen as this evil, a super horny button, like a mini penis disconnected riding the orbits of the earth, claws and a cape.

Janice Mulloy Wieck
I met Janice when I was young and wrote her a letter, I felt as thought our relationship was supposed to get better the more and more I learned, I think she has a tremendous head cold and must take the information presented to her seriously.

Joann Van Rainbow Mulloy
I never Let people lie about my daughter, but the Real gig is to have an associative part in my life, and to be sure of likes and dislikes, and o have her set up for success. Pretty easy being a Clean Freak. 
John Mulloy
I witness John, my brother, get beaten by my mom. I find him to be clever and cue-tickery, and he totally should always like how he is treated because the other threshold isn’t very beguning. As in meet with the threshold sometimes, gaining high intensity and Letting go. A funnel cloud! Haha
John Mulloy Sr.
My dad likes to laugh and holds pretty parties and thinks of doing girls makeup. He is kind of annoying sometimes, but gets by doing a simple palm petit and Doesn’t need to surrender just needs to make sense of things.

She said something weird to my stepmom about egg and reproduction surgery which I am highly against, and I just didn’t like that my parents used to make fun of her thought she seemed not to mind so I guess I learned that some people need some roughage to keep going, and I certainly don’t because I am a diety.
Katy Pery

I haven’t met Kria Brekkan yet. In my mindframe, someone hacked me while I was in the hospital and I thought it was uncalled for then I thought of David and she got brought up and it just wasn’t a Truth Factory, I don’t typically talk to people who make things up, I like starch and sweet and Clear, like I’m Not gonna destroy a carton of ice cream without saying grace.

Larry Wieck
I met Larry when I was 13. He was some nuancance of my grandmother’s who wasn’t the most appealing to me, so I just think about him not selling a house and it seems fitting. 
Larry Wieck
Larry, if he were to get good and take his step by asking for a friend to get a tattoo of a sunflower with om inside and ask another friend to come with, he would step over this hump of just cooking YALL. Kinda gross reminds me of petrol.
Laura Mars
Heated conversations at continuum I am assuming. I think this girl is a criminal, and yall should surround like I saw, and Root On! And Then she’ll have klefulkta confuse when she gets caught! But, is she a chef, I think that cooking No More South Korea would be funny. We met in Austin. 
Leslie Davis
We met in high school, she was an upper classman, she is very rude and I don’t know if she has the stamina or guttural strength in cores of planets as well as shooting out or purging waters of the vagina to assume that her system was built on a guilty figure of “oh I was almost”.

Shachi Merchant

If Shachi heals by going full circle with his pursuit of wanting to be a chef than maybe he will heal back into May I bother You.

Walter’s Son
He is a chef! We met when I was 26, barely. It was nice of him to help his dad renovate. I think he would be good in department thinking about The Titles of the Shreds and the Normalcy of the Guest Appearance.
